              <p>
                I am an Management Information Systems student that has dedicated to optimizing systems through data-driven analysis. 
                Combining technical skills in Java and SQL with hands-on experience in QA and Operations, 
                I translate complex business needs into reliable software solutions. 
                I thrive at the intersection of technical execution and strategic requirement gathering.
              </p>
              <p>
                I specialize in identifying system requirements and streamlining 
                workflows using <strong>Power BI</strong> and <strong>Agile methodologies</strong>. 
                By conducting rigorous functional testing and ensuring data integrity, 
                I align software performance with key organizational milestones.
              </p>
              <p>
                Outside of school and work, I stay active through sports like 
                volleyball, soccer, and basketball. I am also 
                heavily involved on campus through Student Government  
                and various clubs. When I'm not on the court or in a committee meeting, 
                I enjoy diving into a good book or hanging out with friends.
